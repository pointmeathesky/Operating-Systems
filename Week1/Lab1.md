After setting up ubuntu server in VirtualBox I cloned the repo 
Then I ran ``` sudo apt update``` and ``` sudo apt upgrade``` before installing gcc with ```sudo apt install gcc```
I used gcc to with the comman ``` gcc cpu.c ``` -o cpu and then ran the file with ``` ./cpu A ```

Running threads.c

For io.c, when you run the program the output is sent to /tmp/file so I ran cat to check that the program had run correctly
